Working:
	Abyte0_DarkWizard
	Abyte0_Fletch (can't walk on 511, 444, looks like a bug with openrsc?)
	Abyte0_Paladin (save for tile bug)
	AlchWheatApos
	ASCGiants (so far)



	S_Pickpocket: get nearest bank broken???

	
Promising but broken:
	Abyte0_Paladin: if chest has been looted, can't get out via normal means, as the door is 'already unlocked' lol.
					fix: specify optional parameter for openDoor() to force using the first method.

Completely broken:
	GnomeAgilityApos: fails to click net? (tile bug?)
	Abyte0_Nature: thieves OK for a while then breaks after 2 nats. not sure if this ever worked. (tile bug?)

Untested:
	Abyte0_Flax
	Abyte0_Nature
	AlchPlates
